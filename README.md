GAMECO wanted to use its historical sales video games sales data spanning different platforms, genre and publishing studios, to answer the following questions and inform the development of new games.
● Are certain types of games more popular than others?
● What other publishers will likely be the main competitors in certain markets?
● Have any games decreased or increased in popularity over time?
● How have their sales figures varied between geographic regions over time?
